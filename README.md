# enduranceRacesAPIProject
API Capstone at Thinkful

This application is designed to produce videos via the YouTube API that can be viewed in one central repository that collects them for the most beautiful endurance races in the world.  

When finished, there will be a list of these races that the user can select from, which will then render the videos pertaining to that race.

Other functionalities may be added in later versions.

Races can be added to the list by the Administrator based on user feedback and suggestions.
