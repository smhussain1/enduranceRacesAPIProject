# enduranceRacesAPIProject

This application is designed to produce a list of the most beautiful endurance races in the world, that the user can select from, which will then render the videos pertaining to that race, via the YouTube API. 

Other functionalities may be added in later versions.

Races can be added to the list by the Administrator based on user feedback and suggestions.

## Motivation

I wanted to create the resource that I have been looking for, and one that can grow and expand and inspire others as it does.
